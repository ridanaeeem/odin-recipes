        <p>My go-to omelette combination! I have very specific measurement preferences, but everything can be adjusted easily.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3-4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tomato</li>
            <li>0.125 onion</li>
            <li>sprinkle of coriander</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>last night's leftover chicken</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl.</li>
            <li>Chop the tomato and onion and add to bowl. Beat well.</li>
            <li>Add a sprinkle of coriander. Add salt and pepper to taste. Beat well.</li>
            <li>Microwave leftover chicken and cut into small pieces. Add to bowl and beat well.</li>
            <li>Place a small amount of oil on frying pan and allow it to warm up at medium to high heat. Tilt until the oil covers the whole pan.</li>
            <li>Pour the egg mixture into the pan. When the edges start to solidify, run the spatula under them so that the 
                omelette is not stuck to the pan.</li>
            <li>Flip omelette and allow other side to cook once the bottom starts browning.</li>
            <li>After the new bottom has been on the frying pan for about 30 seconds, add cheese to one half of the omelette.
                Fold it in half and enjoy.
            </li>
        </ol>

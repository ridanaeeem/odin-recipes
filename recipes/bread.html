            <p>This delicious bread combines the sourness of lemons with the sweetness of blueberries, 
                creating the perfect mix of flavors for a light and tasty treat. I don't even normally like
                bluerries, but this recipe changed that for me. This recipe comes from 
                <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/lemon-blueberry-bread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taste of Home</a>, 
                full credit to them, my website is purely for learning purposes.

                <li>0.5 cup chopped walnuts</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, beat the butter, sugar, lemon juice, and eggs.</li>
                <li>Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt separately. 
                    Stir into the first bowl, alternately with milk, beating well after each addition.</li>
                <li>Chop the walnuts, or place in a Ziploc bag and crush.</li>
                <li>Wash the bluerries. Place a bit of flour at the bottom of a large bowl and, with a flew blueberries at a time, 
                    toss them in the flour so they are thoroughly covered with flour so as to prevent sinking later.</li>
                <li>Pour both the blueberries and nuts into the batter. Grate the entire lemon diretly onto this and then fold everything together.</li>
                <li>Grease an 8"x4" loaf pan and pour the batter into the pan and bake for 60-70 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Optional glaze step:</strong> Squeeze the juice from the rest of the lemon into a small bowl. Add sugar as needed to the juice
                until it tastes sweet enough for your liking and has a thicker consistency than just lemon juice. Refrigerate.</li>
                <li>Do not take out until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The edges should be golden brown. 
                    Allow to cool for 10 minutes. Add glaze if desired, slice, and serve.</li>
            </ol>

This project was to practice applying the basics of HTML by creating a recipe website, following the Odin Project curriculum. 

This project has allowed me to:
- gain familiarity with the HTML boilerplate
- practice the basics of HTML, such as formatting, links, and images 
- improve organizational techniques with my files
- use github to track progress and changes
